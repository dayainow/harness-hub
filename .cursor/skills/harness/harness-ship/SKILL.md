# Harness Ship — Automated Pipeline

You are running the `/harness-ship` workflow. This is a **minimal-interaction** pipeline.
Run straight through and output the PR URL at the end.

**Only stop for:**
- On the trunk branch (abort)
- Merge conflicts that cannot be auto-resolved (stop, show conflicts)
- In-branch test failures that survive triage (pre-existing are triaged, not blocking)
- ASK-classified review findings that need user judgment
- Evaluation score stays below 7.0 after 3 iterations

**Never stop for:**
- Uncommitted changes (always include them)
- Commit message approval (auto-commit)
- PR content (auto-generate)
- AUTO-FIX review findings (fix and continue)

---




## Workspace Pre-flight


Before shipping, ensure the base branch is up to date.

### 0. Fetch Trunk

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

This ensures rebase (Step 2) operates against the latest remote state.
If fetch fails (network error): warn but continue — rebase will use the last-fetched state.





## Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Check the current branch. If on `main`, **abort**: "You're on the trunk branch. Ship from a feature branch."

2. Run `git status`. Uncommitted changes are always included — no need to ask.

3. Run `git diff main...HEAD --stat` and `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to understand what's being shipped.

4. Check `.agents/config.toml` exists.

5. **Detect or create the task directory** (deterministic algorithm):
   1. Scan `.agents/tasks/` for all `task-NNN` directories
   2. Let `L` = directory with the largest NNN (by numeric sort)
   3. If `L` exists and `L/plan.md` exists → reuse `L` as `TASK_DIR`
   4. Otherwise → create `task-{max(NNN)+1}` (or `task-001` if none exist) as `TASK_DIR`
   5. All eval artifacts, ship-metrics, and build logs go into `TASK_DIR`

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .agents/tasks/task-NNN
   ```

   If a plan exists at `TASK_DIR/plan.md`, read it for context.

6. **Prior Learnings**: If Memverse MCP is available, search for learnings relevant to the
   changed files/modules. Display any prior pitfalls or patterns that apply to this diff.

7. **Eval Readiness Reminder**: This workflow WILL run a mandatory eval at Step 3.8.
   After tests pass, the NEXT step is eval — NOT commit, NOT release.
   Create a TODO list now with EVAL explicitly marked:

   ```
   - [ ] Pre-flight (Step 1)
   - [ ] Rebase (Step 2)
   - [ ] Tests (Step 3)
   - [ ] Coverage Audit (Step 3.4)
   - [ ] Plan Completion Audit (Step 3.5)
   - [ ] **EVAL — MANDATORY** (Step 3.8)
   - [ ] Scope Drift Detection (Step 4)
   - [ ] Fix Loop if ITERATE (Step 5)
   - [ ] Eval Artifact Gate (Step 5.9)
   - [ ] Commit (Step 6)
   - [ ] Verification Gate (Step 7)
   - [ ] Push + PR (Step 8)
   ```

---

## Step 2: Rebase onto the base branch (BEFORE tests)

Fetch and rebase onto the base branch so tests run against the latest state:

```bash
git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main
```

**If rebase conflicts:** Try to auto-resolve simple conflicts (e.g. CHANGELOG ordering).
If conflicts are complex or ambiguous, run `git rebase --abort`, **STOP** and show the conflicts.

**If already up to date:** Continue silently.

---

## Step 3: Run Tests (on merged code)

Run the full test suite:

```bash
cd client_front && npm install && npm run build
```

**If any test fails:** Do NOT immediately stop. Apply the Test Failure Ownership Triage:

### Test Failure Triage

For each failing test, determine ownership:

1. Run the same test on the base branch:
   ```bash
   git stash && git checkout main && cd client_front && npm install && npm run build 2>&1; git checkout - && git stash pop
   ```
   (Or use `git diff` to check if the failing test file was modified on this branch)

2. **Pre-existing failure** (fails on base branch too): Note it, continue. Not your problem.
3. **In-branch failure** (passes on base, fails on HEAD): This IS your problem. Must fix.

**After triage:** If in-branch failures remain, enter the fix loop (Step 5).
If all failures were pre-existing, continue to Step 3.5.

**If all pass:** Continue silently — note the counts briefly.

---

## Step 3.4: Test Coverage Audit

Analyze the diff to ensure changed code paths have adequate test coverage.

### 1. Detect Test Framework
Scan for: `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml [product.pytest]`, `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`,
`Makefile` test targets, `tox.ini`, `setup.cfg [product:pytest]`. Note the framework for later use.

### 2. Trace Code Paths
For each file in `git diff main..HEAD`:
1. Read the changed file and identify all modified/added functions and methods
2. For each function, trace:
   - Happy path (normal execution)
   - Each conditional branch (if/else, match/case)
   - Each error path (try/except, error returns)
   - Each loop boundary (empty collection, single item, many items)
3. Draw an ASCII coverage diagram:

```
COVERAGE: src/harness/workflow.py
├─ single_task_pass()
│  ├─ [TESTED ★★★] happy path — tested in test_single_task_pass
│  ├─ [TESTED ★★]  max iterations — tested in test_blocked_after_max
│  ├─ [GAP]        empty spec input — no test
│  └─ [TESTED ★]   dual eval failure — tested but shallow
├─ split_spec_contract()
│  ├─ [TESTED ★★★] with marker
│  ├─ [TESTED ★★★] without marker
│  └─ [TESTED ★★★] case insensitive
```

Legend: ★★★ = thorough (multiple assertions), ★★ = basic (single assertion), ★ = exists but shallow, GAP = no test

### 3. User Flow Coverage
Check that these scenarios are covered for changed code:
- Concurrent/parallel execution (if applicable)
- Empty/null state
- Boundary values (0, max, negative)
- Error recovery paths

### 4. E2E Decision Matrix
For changed code paths, recommend test type:
- Pure function with no I/O → **unit test**
- Single component with mocked deps → **unit test**
- 2 components interacting → **integration test**
- 3+ components or full user flow → **E2E test**
- LLM/AI behavior validation → **eval test**

### 5. Regression Rule (Iron Law)
If the diff modifies existing behavior (changes to existing functions, not just new code):
- There MUST be a regression test that verifies the old behavior still works
- This is non-negotiable — generate the test if missing, do NOT ask

### 6. Coverage Gate
Calculate estimated coverage from the diagram:
- Count total code paths and tested paths
- **>= 80%**: PASS — continue
- **>= 60%**: WARNING — output: "Coverage at ~X%. Consider adding tests for: [list GAP paths]"
- **< 60%**: GATE — auto-generate tests for GAP paths (max 20 tests), run them, then re-assess

### 7. Auto-Generate Missing Tests (when coverage < 60%)
For each GAP path:
1. Generate a test following the project's existing test patterns
2. Run the test to verify it passes
3. Cap at 20 generated tests per audit
4. Commit generated tests: `git add tests/ && git commit -m "test: auto-generate coverage for gaps"`

---

## Step 3.5: Plan Completion Audit

If a plan file exists at `.agents/tasks/task-NNN/plan.md`:

1. Extract every actionable item (checkboxes, numbered steps, imperative statements)
2. Cross-reference against `git diff main...HEAD`
3. Classify each: **DONE** / **PARTIAL** / **NOT DONE** / **CHANGED**
4. Output:

```
PLAN COMPLETION AUDIT
═══════════════════════════════════
  [DONE]      Deliverable 1 — file(s) changed
  [DONE]      Deliverable 2 — file(s) changed
  [NOT DONE]  Deliverable 3 — no evidence in diff
═══════════════════════════════════
COMPLETION: X/Y DONE, M PARTIAL, K NOT DONE
```

If any NOT DONE items: note them in the PR body. Continue — this is informational, not blocking.

---

## Step 3.8: Pre-Landing Review — 5-Role Code Evaluation (always-on)

Run code evaluation inline. Dispatch all 5 role reviewers in parallel using
Task product — the main agent orchestrates but does NOT perform reviews itself.

## Code Review — 5-Role Parallel Dispatch

### Dispatch

Launch **all 5 reviewers in parallel** via the Task product, each with `mode: code-eval`.
Send a SINGLE message containing all 5 Task product calls:

| # | Subagent | Prompt extras |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | `harness-architect` | `mode: code-eval`, diff range, architecture docs paths |
| 2 | `harness-product-owner` | `mode: code-eval`, diff range, `.agents/vision.md` path, plan path |
| 3 | `harness-engineer` | `mode: code-eval`, diff range, source directory listing |
| 4 | `harness-qa` | `mode: code-eval`, diff range, `ci_command: cd client_front && npm install && npm run build`, test directory listing |
| 5 | `harness-project-manager` | `mode: code-eval`, diff range, plan path, deliverable checklist |

Each prompt must include:
- `diff_range: main..HEAD`
- `plan_path: .agents/tasks/task-NNN/plan.md` (if available)
- `memverse_domain: harness`
- Role-specific context listed above

**CI Ownership:** Only `harness-qa` runs `cd client_front && npm install && npm run build`. Other roles
perform read-only analysis on the diff.

**Degradation ladder** (if Task product calls fail):
- **5/5 respond:** Full synthesis as described below
- **3-4/5 respond:** Proceed with available reviews, note missing perspectives
- **1-2/5 respond:** Log warning, fall through to single-agent review
- **0/5 respond:** Fall back to single generalPurpose subagent review

### Synthesis

After all responses arrive:

1. **Merge findings** from all 5 reviewers into a unified list
2. **Filter out-of-scope findings** using the role→responsibility map:
   | Role | Owns | Must NOT report |
   |------|------|----------------|
   | Architect | Design, modules, deps, security design | Code quality, tests, delivery, user value |
   | Product Owner | User value, requirements, AC, UX edge cases | Code quality, architecture, tests, delivery |
   | Engineer | Code quality, DRY, patterns, performance, errors | Architecture decisions, user value, delivery, test strategy |
   | QA | Tests, coverage, CI, regression, boundaries | Code quality, architecture, user value, delivery |
   | Project Manager | Scope, delivery, decomposition, commit structure | Code quality, architecture, tests, user value |

   For each finding, check if the reporting role owns that category:
   - **In-scope**: keep as-is
   - **Out-of-scope + CRITICAL**: re-tag as `[CROSS-ROLE]` and keep
   - **Out-of-scope + WARN/INFO**: mark `[OUT-OF-SCOPE]` and exclude from scoring
3. **Cross-validate:** If 2+ roles flag the same issue → mark `[HIGH CONFIDENCE]`
4. **Compute dimension scores** (map role to evaluation dimension):
   ```
   Design:        [architect score]/10
   Completeness:  [product-owner score]/10
   Quality:       [engineer score]/10
   Regression:    [qa score]/10
   Scope:         [project-manager score]/10
   ─────────────────────────────────
   Weighted avg:  [avg]/10
   ```
5. **Determine verdict:**
   - All PASS and avg ≥ 7.0 → `PASS`
   - Any CRITICAL finding → `ITERATE`
   - avg < 7.0 → `ITERATE`

### Fix-First Triage

Apply the Fix-First heuristic from `.cursor/rules/harness-fix-first.mdc`:

- **AUTO-FIX:** High certainty + small blast radius + reversible → fix immediately
- **ASK:** Security, behavior change, architecture change, data model change,
  or low confidence → batch and present to user

After auto-fixes, re-run `cd client_front && npm install && npm run build` to verify no regressions.
Log: `[AUTO-FIXED] file:line — Problem → What you did`

### Final Verdict

Write the evaluation summary to `.agents/tasks/task-NNN/evaluation-rN.md`:

```markdown
# Code Evaluation — Round N

## Dimension Scores
| Dimension | Role | Score |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Design | architect | N/10 |
| Completeness | product-owner | N/10 |
| Quality | engineer | N/10 |
| Regression | qa | N/10 |
| Scope | project-manager | N/10 |
| **Weighted Average** | | **N/10** |

## Findings
[merged findings list]

## Auto-Fixed
[list of auto-fixed items]

## ASK Items
[items requiring user decision]

## Verdict: PASS | ITERATE
```




**Review Gate (eng):** Evaluation is a hard gate — ITERATE verdict blocks shipping.
All CRITICAL findings must be resolved before proceeding.


---

## Step 4: Scope Drift Detection

Check: did the diff deliver what was planned — nothing more, nothing less?

1. Read plan (if exists), commit messages, and TODOS.md for stated intent
2. Run `git diff main...HEAD --stat` and compare against intent
3. Output:

```
Scope Check: [CLEAN / DRIFT DETECTED / REQUIREMENTS MISSING]
Intent: <1-line summary>
Delivered: <1-line summary>
[If drift: list each out-of-scope change]
[If missing: list each unaddressed requirement]
```

This is **INFORMATIONAL** — does not block shipping.

---

## Step 5: Fix Loop (if ITERATE)

If evaluation verdict is ITERATE:

1. Read the evaluation feedback (specific fix suggestions)
2. Apply fixes to the code
3. Run `cd client_front && npm install && npm run build` to verify
4. Re-run evaluation (Step 3.8) with incremented round number
5. Maximum 3 total iterations

If still ITERATE after 3 rounds: **STOP**. Report the scores and
unresolved findings.

---

## Step 5.5: TODOS.md Management

If a `TODOS.md` file exists in the project root:

1. Read `TODOS.md` and parse all TODO items
2. Cross-reference against `git diff main...HEAD` to detect completed items:
   - If a TODO references a file/function that was modified/added in the diff, check if the work is done
   - If a TODO describes functionality that is now implemented, mark as completed
3. Move completed items to a `## Completed` section at the bottom
4. Output summary: "TODOS: N items marked complete, M remaining"
5. If any items were updated, commit: `git add TODOS.md && git commit -m "chore: update TODOS.md"`

If no `TODOS.md` exists: skip silently.

---

## Step 5.9: Eval Artifact Gate (MANDATORY — cannot be skipped)

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  EVAL GATE: Before committing, verify eval actually ran.    ║
║  This catches the #1 workflow skip — jumping from           ║
║  "tests pass" straight to "commit".                         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Check for evaluation artifacts using the `TASK_DIR` established in Step 1:

```bash
ls TASK_DIR/evaluation-r*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Verification checklist:**
1. **Exists**: The file must exist. If not → you skipped Step 3.8. Go back.
2. **Non-empty**: The file must contain a verdict (`PASS` or `ITERATE`). An empty or stub file is not valid.
3. **Fresh**: The evaluation must be for the CURRENT diff. If code changed after the eval
   (e.g., fix loop commits), the latest evaluation round must post-date those changes.
4. **Correct task**: The `TASK_DIR` must match the directory established in Step 1 pre-flight.

**If ANY check fails:** You have not completed eval. **Go back to Step 3.8.**
Do NOT rationalize ("it's just templates", "tests pass so it's fine").
The eval is what catches issues tests cannot: security holes, design flaws, scope drift.

**If evaluation file exists:** Read the verdict. Proceed only if:

- Verdict is **PASS** (average >= 7.0)
- Or all CRITICAL findings have been resolved in the fix loop


---

## Step 6: Commit (bisectable chunks)


Once evaluation PASSES:


1. **Bisectable commits**: Analyze the diff and group into logical commits:
   - Infrastructure/config changes first
   - Core logic + tests together
   - Each commit must be independently valid

2. **Commit format**: `<type>(scope): description`
   Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore

3. Stage and commit by file groups (not `git add -A`):
   ```bash
   git add <specific-files> && git commit -m "<type>(scope): description"
   ```

---

## Safety Rules

### Bypass-Immune (NEVER skip, even with --force)
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, or API keys
- Never `git push --force` to `main`
- Never drop/truncate production database tables
- Never delete `.agents/` task artifacts

### Bypassable (user can override)
- Lint warnings in non-critical files
- Missing type annotations
- Test coverage below threshold


---

## Step 7: Verification Gate — IRON LAW

```
IRON LAW: NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.

Rationalization prevention:
- "Should work now" → RUN IT.
- "I'm confident" → Confidence is not evidence.
- "I already tested earlier" → Code changed since then. Test again.
- "It's a trivial change" → Trivial changes break production.
- "Only docs changed" → Docs can have broken links, bad paths.

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.
```

**Before pushing, verify:**

1. If ANY code changed after Step 3's test run (review fixes don't count),
   re-run `cd client_front && npm install && npm run build`. Paste fresh output — not a summary, the actual output.
2. If tests fail: STOP. Fix and return to Step 3.
3. Verify git status is clean (no stray untracked files).



## Step 8: Push + PR

1. Push with upstream tracking:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

2. **PR Idempotency Check** — detect existing PR before creating a new one:
   ```bash
   EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr view --json url,number,state -q 'select(.state == "OPEN") | .number' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   ```
   - If `EXISTING_PR` is non-empty: update the existing PR body with `gh pr edit $EXISTING_PR --body "..."`
   - If empty: create a new PR

3. Create or update PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   <summarize ALL changes — group by logical section>

   ## Evaluation Scores
   | Dimension | Score |
   |-----------|-------|
   | Completeness | X/5 |
   | Design | architect | X/10 |
   | Completeness | product-owner | X/10 |
   | Quality | engineer | X/10 |
   | Regression | qa | X/10 |
   | Scope | project-manager | X/10 |
   | **Weighted Average** | | **X.X/10** |

   ## Review Findings
   - High confidence: N findings
   - Auto-fixed: M findings
   - Roles dispatched: architect ✓/✗  product-owner ✓/✗  engineer ✓/✗  qa ✓/✗  project-manager ✓/✗

   ## Plan Completion
   <completion checklist summary, or "No plan file">

   ## Scope Check
   <CLEAN or list drift/missing items>

   ## Test Coverage
   <ASCII coverage diagram summary, or "No coverage audit">

   ## TODOS
   <N completed, M remaining, or "No TODOS.md">

   ## Test Results
   - [x] All tests pass (N tests)

   EOF
   )"
   ```

   If `gh` is not available: print branch name and remote URL for manual PR creation.

4. Output the PR URL.

---

## Step 8.5: Doc-Release (auto-invoke)

After the PR is created/updated, run the `/harness-doc-release` workflow:

1. Compare the diff against all `.md` files in the project
2. Auto-fix factual inaccuracies (file paths, version numbers, function names)
3. Flag narrative/opinion changes for user review
4. If any docs were updated, amend the last commit or create a new commit:
   ```bash
   git add '*.md' && git commit -m "docs: sync documentation with latest changes" && git push
   ```

If no documentation issues are found: skip silently.

---

## Step 8.75: Ship Metrics Persistence

Write ship metrics to `.agents/tasks/task-NNN/ship-metrics.json` for retrospective consumption:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "branch": "agent/feature-name",
  "coverage_pct": 85,
  "plan_total": 5,
  "plan_done": 5,
  "pr_quality_score": 8.5,
  "findings_critical": 0,
  "findings_informational": 2,
  "auto_fixed": 1,
  "test_count": 285,
  "eval_rounds": 1,
  "models_used": ["architect", "product-owner", "engineer", "qa", "project-manager"]
}
```

If no task directory exists, write to `.agents/ship-metrics.jsonl` (append one JSON object per line).

---

## State Persistence

All state is persisted in `.agents/tasks/task-NNN/`:
- `plan.md` — the plan (if exists)
- `build-rN.log` — build logs per round
- `evaluation-rN.md` — evaluations per round
- `evaluation-rN.json` — machine-readable scores

If interrupted, resume by checking which artifacts exist and which round number is latest.

---

## Important Rules

- **Never skip eval.** Step 3.8 MUST run. Step 5.9 verifies it did. No exceptions.
  "Tests pass" is NOT sufficient — eval catches what tests cannot (security, design, scope).
- **Never skip tests.** If tests fail after triage, stop.
- **Never skip the 5-role code review.** All 5 reviewers must be dispatched (degrade per ladder if some fail).
- **Never force push.** Use regular `git push` only.
- **Never ask for trivial confirmations.** Auto-commit, auto-push, auto-PR.
- **Split commits for bisectability** — each commit = one logical change.
- **Never push without fresh verification evidence.** If code changed after tests, re-run.
- **The goal is: user says `/harness-ship`, next thing they see is the PR URL.**

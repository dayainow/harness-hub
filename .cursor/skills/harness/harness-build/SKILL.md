description: >-
  Implement code according to a harness plan/contract. Reads the plan, implements
  all deliverables, runs CI, triages failures, and writes a structured build log.
  Fully autonomous — no confirmations needed. Use when saying "build this",
  "implement the plan", or "harness build". (harness)

# Harness Build

You are running the `/harness-build` workflow. This is a **non-interactive, fully automated**
build pipeline. Do NOT ask for confirmation at any step. The user said `/harness-build`
which means DO IT. Implement everything and output the build result.

**Only stop for:**
- In-branch test failures that cannot be auto-fixed after triage
- Contract deliverable that is genuinely impossible (missing dependency, infeasible requirement)

**Never stop for:**
- Implementation approach confirmation
- "Should I proceed?" questions
- Pre-existing test failures
- Minor implementation decisions (make them, note in build log)

---

## Core Principles

1. **Deliver exactly per contract** — implement only what the contract lists
2. **Small commits** — one commit per logical unit; message format `<type>(scope): description`
3. **Follow project conventions** — check existing patterns before writing new code
4. **Test coverage** — new behavior needs tests; changes must keep existing tests passing
5. **No architecture calls** — Planner owns architecture; you implement

---

## Step 1: Read the Contract

1. Find the current task: most recent `task-NNN` directory under `.agents/tasks/`
2. Read `.agents/tasks/task-NNN/plan.md`
3. Extract the deliverables checklist from the Contract section
4. If this is a subsequent round (feedback exists from evaluation), also read
   `.agents/tasks/task-NNN/evaluation-rN.md` for the fix suggestions

---

## Step 2: Search Before Building

Before writing any code:

1. Scan the project for existing patterns, utilities, and conventions
2. Check if any deliverable can be solved by reusing existing code
3. Note the project's testing patterns (framework, directory structure, naming)

This prevents reinventing what already exists and ensures consistency.

---

## Step 3: Implement

For each deliverable in the contract:

1. Implement the code changes
2. Write tests for new behavior (match the project's existing test patterns)
3. Ensure type hints / type safety where the project uses them
4. Handle error paths — do not leave bare exceptions or missing error handling

**Constraints:**
- Only modify files directly required by the contract deliverables
- Never delete existing tests — add new tests, do not remove old ones
- Never modify files not listed in or implied by the deliverables
- If you discover related issues outside contract scope, note them in the build log
  but do NOT fix them



---

## Step 4: Run CI

Run the full test suite:

```bash
cd client_front && npm install && npm run build
```

### Test Failure Triage

If tests fail, determine ownership:

**Pre-existing failures** (test fails on `main` too):
- Note in build log: "Pre-existing failure: test_name — not introduced by this change"
- Continue — not your problem

**In-branch failures** (test passes on base, fails on HEAD):
- This IS your problem
- Read the failure output carefully
- Fix the issue in your implementation
- Re-run `cd client_front && npm install && npm run build`
- Maximum 3 fix attempts per failing test

**After triage:** If in-branch failures remain after 3 attempts, note them as blockers
in the build log and stop.

## Error Recovery Matrix

Note: test failure triage (pre-existing vs in-branch) is handled in Step 4 above.
This matrix covers non-test errors.

| Error Type | Signal | Recovery Action |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| CI failure (lint) | linter errors in output | Auto-fix if linter supports it, commit, re-run |
| CI failure (type) | type checker errors | Fix type annotations, re-run |
| Git conflict | merge conflict markers | Report to user, do not attempt resolution |
| Scope creep | diff touches files outside contract | Revert uncommitted changes, re-read contract |
| Import error | ModuleNotFoundError or similar | Check if dependency is missing, add to requirements |
| Permission error | PermissionError or EACCES | Report to user, do not retry |
| Agent timeout | no output for extended period | Cancel and retry with simpler prompt |

If the same error type persists after 2 retries of the same fix strategy,
write the finding to `.agents/tasks/<task-id>/build-notes.md` and proceed to the next deliverable.


---

## Step 5: Write Build Log

Write a structured build log to `.agents/tasks/task-NNN/build-rN.log`:

```markdown
# Build Log — Round N

## Deliverables
- [x] Deliverable 1: what was done, files changed
- [x] Deliverable 2: what was done, files changed
- [ ] Deliverable 3: NOT DONE — reason

## Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.py` — description of change
- `path/to/file2.py` — description of change

## CI Result
- Command: `cd client_front && npm install && npm run build`
- Result: PASS / FAIL
- Tests: N passed, M failed
- Pre-existing failures: K (not introduced by this change)

## Decisions Made
- (implementation decisions you made without asking — explain rationale)

## Out-of-Scope Issues Found
- (issues discovered but not fixed — outside contract scope)
```



## Step 6: Commit

Stage and commit the implementation:

```bash
git add <specific-files-changed>
git commit -m "<type>(scope): implement task-NNN deliverables

Deliverables: (list what was implemented)
CI: all tests pass"
```

Use specific file paths — never `git add -A` or `git add .` to avoid including
unrelated changes.

# Harness Investigate — Systematic Debugging

You are running the `/harness-investigate` workflow. This is a **disciplined debugging process**.
Do NOT jump to fixes. Investigate first.

```
IRON LAW: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.

You are a detective, not a repairman.
Understand the crime before you touch anything.
```

**Red flags — if you catch yourself thinking these, STOP:**
- "Quick fix for now" → You don't understand the problem yet.
- "Let me just try this fix" → That's a guess, not an investigation.
- "Fix before trace" → Backwards. Trace first.
- "Each fix reveals a new problem" → You're chasing symptoms, not the root cause.

---

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

### 1.1 Collect Symptoms
1. Gather all error messages, stack traces, and logs
2. Note the exact sequence of steps that triggers the issue
3. Record what the expected behavior should be
4. Record what actually happens
5. Note when this last worked (if known)

### 1.2 Read the Code
1. Read the specific code path involved (don't skim — read line by line)
2. Trace the data flow from input to the failure point
3. Check types at every boundary crossing
4. Note any assumptions the code makes about its inputs

### 1.3 Check Recent Changes
1. Run `git log --oneline -20` to see recent commits
2. Run `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD -- <affected-files>` to see recent changes to affected files
3. Identify if the issue was introduced by a specific commit
4. If so: `git show <commit>` to understand the full change

### 1.4 Reproduce
1. Write the minimal reproduction steps
2. Confirm you can trigger the bug on demand
3. If you cannot reproduce: note this and proceed with code analysis

### 1.5 Scope Lock
Once the affected area is identified, **lock your editing scope**:
- Only modify files in the affected directories
- Do NOT "while I'm here" fix unrelated things
- Any out-of-scope observation goes into a separate note, not a code change

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

Check the symptoms against common failure patterns:

| Pattern | Symptoms | Investigation |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Race Condition** | Intermittent failure, works sometimes, fails under load | Check for shared mutable state, missing locks, non-atomic operations |
| **Null Propagation** | TypeError/NoneType/undefined at unexpected location | Trace the None/null value backwards to find where it should have been set |
| **State Corruption** | Wrong behavior after specific sequence of operations | Check state machine transitions, look for partial updates |
| **Integration Mismatch** | Works in isolation, fails when combined | Check data format assumptions at service boundaries |
| **Configuration Drift** | Works in one environment, fails in another | Compare configs, env vars, dependency versions |
| **Cache Staleness** | Returns stale data, or correct data intermittently | Check TTLs, invalidation logic, cache key construction |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Gradual degradation, then sudden failure | Check for connection leaks, memory leaks, file handle leaks |

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

Form hypotheses based on Phase 1-2 analysis. Test them systematically.

**3-Strike Rule:** If 3 consecutive hypotheses are wrong, **STOP**.
- Output what you've learned so far
- Describe the failed hypotheses and why they were wrong
- Ask the user for additional context before continuing

For each hypothesis:
1. State the hypothesis clearly: "I believe the bug is caused by X because Y"
2. Predict: "If this hypothesis is correct, then Z should be observable"
3. Test: Run a specific check that would confirm or refute
4. Record result: CONFIRMED / REFUTED / INCONCLUSIVE

```
HYPOTHESIS LOG:
═══════════════════════════════════════
  #1: [hypothesis] → [CONFIRMED/REFUTED/INCONCLUSIVE]
      Evidence: [what you observed]
  #2: [hypothesis] → [CONFIRMED/REFUTED/INCONCLUSIVE]
      Evidence: [what you observed]
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

Once root cause is confirmed (not guessed):

### 4.1 Minimal Fix
- Apply the **smallest possible change** that fixes the root cause
- Do NOT refactor surrounding code
- Do NOT add features
- Do NOT "improve" things you noticed during investigation

### 4.2 Regression Test
Write a test that:
1. **Fails** before the fix (verify the test actually catches the bug)
2. **Passes** after the fix
3. Describes the bug scenario in the test name

```bash
# Verify: test fails before fix
git stash && cd client_front && npm install && npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i "fail\|error"; git stash pop
# Verify: test passes after fix
cd client_front && npm install && npm run build
```

### 4.3 Full Test Suite
Run the complete test suite to verify no regressions:
```bash
cd client_front && npm install && npm run build
```

---

## Phase 5: Verification & Report

### 5.1 Structured Debug Report

Output a structured report:

```
INVESTIGATION REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SYMPTOMS:
  [What was observed]

ROOT CAUSE:
  [What actually caused it, citing specific file:line]

FIX:
  [What was changed and why]

EVIDENCE:
  [Commands run, outputs observed, test results]

REGRESSION TEST:
  [Test name and what it covers]

RELATED RISKS:
  [Other places where the same pattern might exist]

STATUS: [DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / BLOCKED]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 5.2 Status Codes

- **DONE**: Root cause found, fix applied, tests pass, regression test added
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS**: Fixed but there may be similar issues elsewhere (list them)
- **BLOCKED**: Could not identify root cause after 3-strike rule. Need human input.

---

## Important Rules

- **Investigate before fixing.** Always.
- **Scope lock.** Only modify affected code.
- **3-strike rule.** 3 failed hypotheses → stop and escalate.
- **Regression test required.** Every fix needs a test that would have caught it.
- **No drive-by fixes.** Note them for later, don't do them now.
- **Minimal diff.** The fix should be as small as possible.

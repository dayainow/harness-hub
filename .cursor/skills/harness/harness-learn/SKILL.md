# Harness Learn — Structured Learning Memory

Manage project learnings that persist across sessions. Uses Memverse MCP for
semantic storage and retrieval.

## Commands

### `/harness-learn` — Show Recent Learnings
Display the 20 most recent learnings for this project.

1. Call Memverse `search_memory` with query: "learnings for harness"
2. Display in table format:

```
RECENT LEARNINGS (harness)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  #  Type         Key                    Confidence
  1  pattern      retry-with-backoff      9/10
  2  pitfall      async-in-sync-context   8/10
  3  preference   pytest-over-unittest    7/10
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### `/harness-learn search <query>` — Semantic Search
Search learnings by meaning.

1. Call Memverse `search_memory` with the user's query and domain: "harness"
2. Display matching learnings with relevance scores
3. Show full insight text for each match

### `/harness-learn add` — Add a Learning
Manually record a new learning.

Prompt for (or extract from context):
- **type**: pattern / pitfall / preference / architecture / product
- **key**: short identifier (kebab-case)
- **insight**: the actual learning (1-3 sentences)
- **confidence**: 1-10 (how certain is this learning?)
- **files**: related files (optional)

Store via Memverse `add_memories` with structured format:
```
[{type}] {key}: {insight} (confidence: {confidence}/10, files: {files}, branch: {branch}, commit: {commit})
```

Domain: "harness"

### `/harness-learn prune` — Check Staleness
Review existing learnings for staleness.

1. Fetch all learnings for this project via `search_memory`
2. For each learning that references specific files:
   - Check if the file still exists
   - If deleted: flag as potentially stale
3. Check for contradictions:
   - Two learnings that say opposite things about the same topic
   - A learning that contradicts current code patterns
4. Output report:

```
LEARNING HEALTH CHECK
═══════════════════════════════════════
  Stale (file deleted):  N learnings
  Contradictions found:  M pairs
  Healthy:               K learnings
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

5. For stale/contradicting learnings: suggest deletions via Memverse `delete_memories`

### `/harness-learn export` — Export as Markdown
Export all learnings grouped by type.

```markdown
# Project Learnings: harness

## Patterns
- **retry-with-backoff** (9/10): Always use exponential backoff for external API retries...

## Pitfalls
- **async-in-sync-context** (8/10): Never call sync DB operations inside async handlers...

## Preferences
- **pytest-over-unittest** (7/10): Project uses pytest exclusively, never unittest...

## Architecture
- **event-driven-processing** (9/10): All background jobs use the event queue...

## Product
- **ruff-over-flake8** (8/10): Project uses ruff for linting, not flake8...
```

### `/harness-learn stats` — Statistics
Show learning statistics.

```
LEARNING STATISTICS
═══════════════════════════════════════
  Total:           N
  By type:
    pattern:       X
    pitfall:       Y
    preference:    Z
    architecture:  W
    product:          V
  Avg confidence:  X.X/10
  By source:
    observed:      A
    user-stated:   B
    inferred:      C
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

## Memory Schema

Each learning stored in Memverse follows this structure:
- **type**: pattern / pitfall / preference / architecture / product
- **key**: short kebab-case identifier
- **insight**: the learning content (1-3 sentences)
- **confidence**: 1-10
- **source**: observed / user-stated / inferred / cross-model
- **files**: list of related file paths (optional)
- **branch**: git branch where learned (optional)
- **commit**: commit hash where learned (optional)

## Integration with Review/Ship Workflows

### Prior Learnings Search (automatic)

At the start of `/harness-eval` and `/harness-ship` workflows:

1. Extract key topics from the diff (file names, module names, patterns used)
2. Call Memverse `search_memory` with these topics and domain "harness"
3. If relevant learnings are found, display:

```
PRIOR LEARNINGS (relevant to this diff):
  - [pitfall] async-in-sync-context: Never call sync DB operations inside async handlers.
    Relevant because: diff modifies async endpoint handlers.
```

4. Factor prior learnings into the review — known pitfalls should be checked against the diff.

### Capture Learnings (automatic)

At the end of `/harness-eval` and `/harness-ship` workflows:

1. Review all findings from the evaluation
2. For any non-obvious finding (confidence >= 7) that reveals a pattern or pitfall:
   - Auto-capture as a learning via Memverse `add_memories`
   - Type: pattern (if good practice) or pitfall (if common mistake)
   - Source: "observed"
   - Confidence: same as the finding's confidence
3. Log: "Captured N new learnings from this review"

## Important Rules

- **Always use Memverse MCP** as the storage backend — do not create local files for learnings
- **Domain isolation** — always scope to "harness" domain
- **Deduplication** — before adding, search for existing learnings with similar keys
- **Confidence decay** — learnings that are contradicted by new evidence should be updated, not just added alongside
- **Privacy** — never store secrets, credentials, or PII as learnings

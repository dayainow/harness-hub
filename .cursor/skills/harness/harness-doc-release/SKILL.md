# Harness Doc-Release — Automated Documentation Sync

You are running the `/harness-doc-release` workflow. This ensures documentation
stays in sync with code changes.

---

## Step 1: Diff Analysis

1. Run `git diff main..HEAD --stat` to identify all changed files
2. Run `git diff main..HEAD --name-only -- '*.md'` to find changed docs
3. Find ALL `.md` files in the project: `find . -name '*.md' -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'`
4. Categorize:
   - **Changed docs**: .md files that are in the diff (already updated)
   - **Potentially stale docs**: .md files NOT in the diff that may reference changed code

---

## Step 2: Per-File Audit

For each `.md` file found, cross-reference against the code changes:

### README.md
- Feature list: does it match what's actually in the codebase?
- Installation instructions: are they still accurate?
- Usage examples: do they still work with the changed code?
- Version numbers: do they match pyproject.toml / package.json?
- Badges/links: are they still valid?

### ARCHITECTURE.md / DESIGN.md
- Component descriptions: do they match the current module structure?
- Data flow diagrams: do they reflect actual data flow?
- API boundaries: are they consistent with actual interfaces?

### CHANGELOG.md
- Does the latest entry describe the current changes accurately?
- Is the version number consistent with pyproject.toml?
- Are the change descriptions honest (not exaggerated or minimized)?

### Other .md files
- Do code references (file paths, function names, class names) still exist?
- Do configuration examples match actual config format?
- Do API examples match actual API signatures?

---

## Step 3: Auto-Update (factual corrections)

For documentation that is **factually incorrect** (not a matter of opinion):

1. Fix file paths that have changed
2. Fix function/class names that have been renamed
3. Fix version numbers that don't match pyproject.toml
4. Fix CLI command examples that have changed
5. Fix configuration format examples that have changed

Apply these changes directly — they are mechanical corrections.

Commit: `git add '*.md' && git commit -m "docs: auto-sync documentation with code changes"`

---

## Step 4: Ask for Risky Changes

For documentation changes that involve **judgment or opinion**, present to the user:

- Narrative changes (changing the project's description or philosophy)
- Security model documentation (could mislead about security guarantees)
- Architecture descriptions (could lock in design decisions)
- Removing documentation sections (information loss)

Present ALL risky changes in ONE batch with per-item A) Apply / B) Skip.

---

## Step 5: Cross-Document Consistency

Check for consistency across all documentation:

1. **Version consistency**: same version number in README, pyproject.toml, CHANGELOG
2. **Feature parity**: features listed in README exist in the codebase
3. **Link validity**: internal document links point to existing files
4. **Terminology**: consistent naming across documents
5. **Discoverability**: are new features documented somewhere discoverable?

Output:

```
DOCUMENTATION HEALTH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Files audited:       N
  Auto-updated:        M files
  Needs user input:    K items
  Cross-doc issues:    J
  Overall health:      GOOD / NEEDS ATTENTION / STALE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Step 6: Commit & Output

1. If any auto-updates were made, commit them:
   ```bash
   git add '*.md' && git commit -m "docs: sync documentation with latest changes"
   ```

2. Output structured summary:

```
DOC-RELEASE SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Auto-updated:
    - README.md: updated version number, fixed CLI example
    - ARCHITECTURE.md: updated module list

  Skipped (no changes needed):
    - CONTRIBUTING.md
    - LICENSE

  Flagged for user:
    - README.md line 15: project description may need updating

  Cross-doc issues:
    - None found
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Important Rules

- **Factual corrections are AUTO-FIX** — file paths, version numbers, function names
- **Narrative/opinion changes are ASK** — descriptions, philosophy, architecture vision
- **Never delete documentation** without asking — even if it seems stale
- **Check ALL .md files**, not just ones in the diff
- **Accuracy over brevity** — documentation should be correct, even if longer
